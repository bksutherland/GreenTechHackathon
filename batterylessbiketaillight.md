<p>A bicycle is a must for reducing the carbon impact of transportation and Dutch design culture is really at the fore of integrating bicycle-use into daily life.  One current problem with the use of bicycles year-round and at any time of day however, is the use after dark particularly during the winter in northern climates, making bright lighting desirable for safer travelling.   This recipe makes use of one hybrid supercapacitor, an old tuna tin, an applesauce container, and some blinky red LEDs.  Unlike batteries, supercapacitor voltages are minimally affected by extreme cold.</p>
