<h1>Hardware Hacks for Batteryless Energy Harvesting Electronics and Computing</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Green technology is about reducing the use of materials, energy, and waste systems and their associated carbon footprints.  This collection documents specific hardware hacks around the use of energy harvesting, batteryless electricity storage, and upcycling prior materials, in the creation of novel sustainable consumer electronics such as media players and computing devices.</p>
<p><b>Energy harvesting</b> is a strategy where natural sources of ambient energy are converted to stored fuel in various ways.  The ability to make fuel, to absorb ambient energy from the surroundings and render it into useful electricity, makes electricity systems (writ large, like grids) and at consumer scale: devices uniquely non-consuming and sustainable (therefore green).   Wind turbines and solar collectors are a common means of energy harvesting, but a variety of arcane systems exist as well.  Trees for example manifest enough electricity to power small internet of things devices <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2032293">(Himes, et. al., 2010).</a></p>
<p><b>Batterylessness</b> is possible in the sense that electricity can be stored physically as well as chemically.  In 1746, Leiden University professor <a href="https://top450.universiteitleiden.nl/en/items/de-uitvinding-van-de-condensator">Pieter van Musschenbroek invented the capacitor</a>, which stores electricity as static charge on non-conducting glass layers, like rubbing a balloon on one's head.  Initially, the capacitors stored small amounts of high voltages, making them somewhat dangerous.  However in 1954, the same year solar panels were invented, low voltage storage capacitors, or supercapacitors were invented by <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/f8/a9/b7d5c04a415c8b/US2800616.pdf">Becker and Ferry</a>.  One of the things noted in the invention patent was that depleting the capacitor completely seemed to have no effect on it's future ability to store charge.  This means that unlike batteries, capacitors last for millions of recharges, and decades of use.  Given that the world goes through 15 billion batteries each year, it is odd that there aren't more devices like a solar calculator that just going and going!  There's also the phenomenon of battery obsolescence in devices -- people discard them when they don't store power properly.</p>
<p><b>Upcycling</b> recognizes that not only is there a vast quantity of batteries being wasted, but that electronics devices themselves are discarded at an unprecidented rate, vastly outpacing proper disposal and recycling programs.  Would it be possible to make use of the generic parts in new creations?   Musical instruments being absolutely standardized and objects of care appreciate with time, resulting in fewer being discarded.  Degrowth or the slowing down of consumption is mainly about treating the things we own differently with respect to maintenance and repair.</p>
