<p>A bicycle is a must for reducing the carbon impact of transportation and Dutch design culture is really at the fore of integrating bicycle-use into daily life.  One current problem with the use of bicycles year-round and at any time of day however, is the use after dark particularly during the winter in northern climates, making brighter, more sustainable lighting desirable for safer travelling.  This is where the hybrid supercapacitor can really score -- 500,000x recharges, and the light is made from ewaste and a few cheap electronics components. This recipe makes use of one hybrid supercapacitor, an old tuna tin, an applesauce container, and some blinky red LEDs.  Unlike batteries, supercapacitor voltages are minimally affected by extreme cold.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cat foot tin</li>
  <li>Applesauce container (I discovered it's the right size to clip on)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/589">Small protoboard</a> or cut a large one</li>
  <li>TP4056 USB recharger (about twenty cents Canadian) can be recovered as ewaste from discarded battery banks or "power blocks"</li>
  <li>Schottky diodes</li>
  <li>Eaton 220F hybrid supercapacitor</li>
</ul>
