<h1>Hardware Hacks for Batteryless Energy Harvesting Electronics and Computing</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Green technology is about reducing the use of materials, energy, and waste systems and their associated carbon footprints.  This collection documents specific hardware hacks around the use of energy harvesting, batteryless electricity storage, and upcycling prior materials, in the creation of novel sustainable consumer electronics such as media players and computing devices.</p>
<p><b>Energy harvesting</b> is a strategy where natural sources of ambient energy are converted to stored fuel in various ways.  The ability to make fuel, to absorb ambient energy from the surroundings and render it into useful electricity, makes electricity systems (writ large, like grids) and at consumer scale: devices uniquely non-consuming and sustainable (therefore green).   Wind turbines and solar collectors are a common means of energy harvesting, but a variety of arcane systems exist as well.  Trees for example manifest enough electricity to power small internet of things devices <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2032293">(Himes, et. al., 2010).</a></p>
<p><b>Batterylessness</b> is possible in the sense that electricity can be stored physically as well as chemically.  In 1746, Leiden University professor <a href="https://top450.universiteitleiden.nl/en/items/de-uitvinding-van-de-condensator">Pieter van Musschenbroek invented the capacitor</a>, which stores electricity as static charge on a non-conducting surface layers, like rubbing a balloon on one's head.  Initially, capacitors stored small amounts of high voltages, making them somewhat dangerous.  However in 1954, the same year solar panels were invented, low voltage storage capacitors, which came to be called supercapacitors were invented.</p>
