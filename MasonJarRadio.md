<h1>Batteryless FM Radio in a Mason Jar</h1>
<p>The Public Rad.io is a single station FM Tuner in a Mason jar <a href="https://github.com/The-Public-Radio">open source project</a> by Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright.
Their blog discusses how they used the mason jar just because they had one handy and needed to test the speaker radios, but the general benefit is that it is an established standard for packaging goods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_jar">since 1858</a>.</p>
