<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>                                                                         
<p><a href="https://thepublicrad.io">The Public Rad.io</a> is a single station FM Tuner in a Mason jar <a href="https://github.com/The-Public-Radio">open source project</a> by Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/centerlinelabs/kickstarter-gold-the-public-radio-the-single-stati?ref=44759g">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a> into being.
Their blog discusses how they used the mason jar just because they had one handy and needed to test the speaker radios, but the general benefit is that it in choosing an established standard for packaging goods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_jar">since 1858</a>, it is easy to change the container for the radio.  Note that it isn't actually a single station radio, it is possible for a user to change the station by unscrewing the jar and hitting the seek button. Few listeners are actually station-hoppers, though: most prefer to return to their favourite station and programming.</p>

We begin by removing the AA battery clips and soldering in a postive red wire and a negative black wire.   Although this radio uses a small amount of current, using large wires with low power sources has been shown to have a benefit and it supports the longevity of the device.

The solar cell we will use is this one, it is rated for 3.5V but in full sun it will produce 4.2V.  When solar cells are used to charge capacitors, they always charge to the open circuit voltage, not the rated voltage, due to the lack of resistance compared with batteries.
