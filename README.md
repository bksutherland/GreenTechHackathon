<h1>Hardware Hacks for Batteryless Energy Harvesting Electronics and Computing</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Green technology is about reducing the use of materials, energy, and waste systems and their associated carbon footprints.  This collection documents specific hardware hacks around the use of energy harvesting, batteryless electricity storage, and upcycling prior materials, in the creation of novel sustainable consumer electronics such as media players and computing devices.</p>
<p><b>Energy harvesting</b> is a strategy from nature where natural sources of ambient energy is converted to stored fuel in various ways.  An ability to make fuel, to absorb ambient energy from the surroundings and render it into useful electricity, makes electronics devices uniquely non-consuming and sustainable (therefore green).</p>
