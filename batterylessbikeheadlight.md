<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>                                                                         
<p>As I previously mentioned, a bicycle is a must for reducing the carbon impact of transportation and Dutch design culture, along with many green technology concerned places, is at the fore of integrating bicycle-use into daily life. One current problem with the use of bicycles year-round or at any time of day, is the dark particularly during the winter in northern climates.  Being seen on a bicycle would benefit from more sustainable lighting, desirable for safer travelling. This is where the hybrid supercapacitor can really score -- 500,000x recharges, it isn't affected by cold like batteries. The bicycle headlight circuit is similar to the <a href="https://github.com/bksutherland/GreenTechHackathon/blob/main/batterylessbiketaillight.md">bicycle taillight project</a> except the design is more directional, requires a brighter LED and larger batteryless power supply.  For this it is useful to find an old length of waterproof tube, either gas or water piping.   The recipe makes use of the larger, 1100F hybrid supercapacitor, a Seiko 1/3/5W warm white LED, a TP4056, a resistor and a 1N4004. Unlike batteries, supercapacitor voltages are minimally affected by temperatures above -25 °C.</p>
